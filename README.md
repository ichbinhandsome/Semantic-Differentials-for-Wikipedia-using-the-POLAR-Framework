## Semantic-Differentials-for-Wikipedia-using-the-POLAR-Framework
**RWTH ForschungPraktikum CSSH**
The goal of our project is to produce word embeddings from a Wikipedia dataset, and to apply the *POLAR framework* to different categories of words (e.g. Countries, Food, Music, etc.) in order to analyse the semantic associations behind concepts on Wikipedia.
The *POLAR framework* is a method that enables interpretability for pre-trained word embeddings by making use of *semantic differentials*.
The semantics of a word can be measured using *semantic differentials* by analysing its position on a scale between a word and its antonym.
In this paper we generate pairs of antonyms, using different methods, which can be used as the *semantic differentials* for the *POLAR framework*.
To evaluate the interpretability of the pairs of antonyms generated, we performed a survey to collect the opinions of people from different countries towards the selected polar opposites.
We compare the results with the conclusion from the *POLAR framework* and evaluate the quality of the *semantic differentials* produced.
